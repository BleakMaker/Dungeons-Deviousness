# Dungeons & Deviousness MCM Configuration
For Dungeons & Deviousness to work properly, the MCM and Skyrim in-game settings should be set as follows.

* AVA
  * The first thing that will happen is you'll be prompted to set your character's attributes using Ava. For D&D, the Adept (18) or Expert (12) settings are recommended. Remember the choices you make in this menu are permanent once you click Accept.

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING WITH THE MCM, WAIT FOR ALL THE MESSAGES IN THE TOP LEFT TO FINISH APPEARING AND THEN SAVE YOUR GAME AND THEN LOAD THAT SAVE. Also, do not equip any weapons/spells until you have exited the Abandoned Prison!**
